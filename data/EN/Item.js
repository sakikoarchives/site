To commemorate her mute friend, Fomenko made quills out of the ten outermost feathers of the parrot's wings. One of these was for herself, while the other nine were stored in a vault.<br>She used her quills to annotate for an entire Amber Era, preserving vast swathes of ancient documents on the verge of being lost. At her funeral, her peers and students burst into tears because \"a lamp that illuminated our cosmic past had been snuffed out.\"<br>It wasn't until people went over Fomenko's legacy that they finally realized that the scribe had been writing nothing but lies with her quills.<br><br><i>\"Since the beginning of human history, the birds have been observing all the glory, folly, and glorious and foolish things humans have accomplished.

But the Vidyadhara could live for a thousand years, much longer than the foxians. Yu searched for ways to release his lover from the grip of death. He fell for the trickery of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and asked his lover to take the longevity medicine of Abundance without telling her what it was. The foxian girl turned into an abomination that no longer loved him before being slain by the Cloud Knights. To prevent Yu, who was overwhelmed by grief, from becoming mara-struck, the Alchemy Commission ordered him to take the Longevity Pill of Cruelty that deprived him of love and desire until his demise.<br>The legend has another version, in which Yu was not of the Vidyadhara but a mere mortal, and the foxian girl was a spy planted by the Disciples to infiltrate the Alchemy Commission. This version is not as popular, for it turns a romance story into a political power struggle.<br><br><i>\"Those who love and live deeply fall into mara, while those who sever desire and passions can live for a millennium.

Its researchers added three Aidens of vector to a Stone of The Hunt on a topological loop band, making the stone chase itself. Thus, the stone was able to achieve limited perpetual motion under specific conditions. The department was not concerned with the loss of Path power in the experiment. Instead, they took notice of another small phenomenon: To tread on its Path, the stone moved at a very low velocity, but the speed was gradually picking up in small increments. The researchers leveraged this and produced Topological Acceleration Band.

To prevent Yu, who was overwhelmed by grief, from becoming mara-struck, the Alchemy Commission ordered him to take the Longevity Pill of Cruelty that deprived him of love and desire until his demise.<br>The legend has another version, in which Yu was not of the Vidyadhara but a mere mortal, and the foxian girl was a spy planted by the Disciples to infiltrate the Alchemy Commission.
