Advance or retreat is always in an orderly manner, which is why the board's square in its orderliness.

They swore an oath to defend the Xianzhou ships and follow Reignbow's decree of The Hunt, a tradition carried out to this day. Despite the incredible longevity of long-life species, few generals have been able to pass the century mark after taking up the mantle due to the bloody nature of warfare. This is not so much fate as it is tradition. As the armed defenders of Xianzhou against crusading abominations, generals not only must take the lead for planning and dispatching, but also take the lead into battle. Amidst countless names erased too quickly and too cruelly in the annals of history, the Divine Foresight Jing Yuan, leader of the Cloud Knights of the Xianzhou Luofu, stands out from the rest with his centuries-old reign. Under his wise strategy, the Luofu's Cloud Knights have made a name for themselves among the Alliance, achieving an exemplary record. While there are those who complained that he feared combat so much so that he seldom resorted to arms, it remains true that his intellect is no less resourceful than the tip of the sharpest sword in solving thorny problems."

Jing Yuan's parents hoped he would inherit the mantle of a scholar or official at the Realm-Keeping Commission, but Jing Yuan grabbed the toy sword.<br><br>It seems like prediction from the birthfate tradition came true. After graduating from the academy, Jing Yuan joined the Cloud Knights to escape from a \"typical\" life against his family's wishes.<br><br>His first expedition was recorded in the official Cloud Knights' battle record. The Navis Astriger carrying the troops had to make a forced landing on an ocean planet infested by abominations. One new long-life species known as Puppeteer Jellyfish hijacked the Cloud Knights' minds, stowing onto the ship and almost converting their warship into an alien hive. Jing Yuan quickly became aware of the crisis and identified the requirements of Puppeteer Jellyfish possession, then devised a way against them. The rest of the crew eventually passed this ordeal amongst identical friends and foes, defeated the real enemies, and returned home to safety.<br><br>This bloodless victory showed Jing Yuan's mettle to the Cloud Knights' generals. After returning to the Xianzhou, Jing Yuan demonstrated his adept skill and was appointed to a position of importance in the Knights.<br><br>His quick-witted and practical approaches had repeatedly given his superiors unforgettable surprises — and headaches. In the end, Jing Yuan was invited by the previous Sword Champion of the Luofu to join her team, and so the legend of the High-Cloud Quintet was formed."
